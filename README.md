# Fossielvrij NL & Groen Pensioen software repository

Scripts for analysing investment data from pension funds and other financial institutes.

This is work in progress. Also the documentation is in progress. Check back later, or feel free to submit an issue to ask questions!

This software was created for Dutch NGOs Fossielvrij NL and Groen Pensioen, with courtesy of German NGO Urgewald for the use of their awesome Global Oil and Gas Exit List and Global Coal Exit List.
